Box plots were made to check the difference in the clinical characteristics such as ALT, AST and TG which are increased during the liver disease in the patients that have the comorbidities and the patients that do not have the comorbidities. It was found that in the patients suffering from the comorbidities there is an increase in the levels of AST and ALT as well as TG levels.
